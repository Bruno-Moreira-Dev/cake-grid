This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.10.

## Before Start

Run `npm install` to install all modules required from package.json. If you run into trouble with module node-sass version 4.13, make sure to downgrade your Node.js version installed to 12 or 13. We saw this trouble running this test on Windows.

## Development

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
